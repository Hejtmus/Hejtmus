## Hello

My name is Filip Holƒç√≠k and I'am a student full-stack web developer. I finished high school as "IT specialist" at SP≈†E Karola Adlera (electrical engineering) in Bratislava, Slovakia. And now I'll be studying IT degree program at VUT FIT in Brno, Czech Republic.

### How my IT passion started

I was gamer since I was 12 year old, but I was gaming on All-In-One computer with notebook performance, to be able to play games comfortably on that HW, I had to tinker with software, at that point I started hating Windows. Despite I hated Windows, I was using it, because I didn't know, there was alternatives. I was gaming like this until I moved to my father.

After I moved to my father, I coludn't play games, because my AIO stayed in my mother's house, and only computer I had was Acer Aspire ONE. Because I moved, I also changed my school, and there I met my friend Simon from my childhood. With Simon we were mostly talking about physics, but once he trashtalked Windows, and I trashtalked as well and then I asked him, what can we do with it. I got answer, use Linux. My mind was blown by the fact, that there is alternative to Windows.
